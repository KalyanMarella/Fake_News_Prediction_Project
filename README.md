# Fake_News_Prediction_Project

Description

Fake News Prediction is a machine learning project designed to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project employs TF-IDF Vectorization, Passive Aggressive Classifier, and Spacy for efficient processing and classification of news articles. By leveraging these advanced techniques, the project aims to differentiate between authentic and misleading news sources, providing users with a reliable tool to assess news credibility.

Techniques Used

- TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts textual data into numerical vectors, enabling machine learning algorithms to process and analyze the data effectively.
- Passive Aggressive Classifier: A type of online learning algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks, used for detecting fake news articles.
- Spacy: An open-source software library for advanced NLP in Python, utilized for tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

Usage

1. Train the model using the provided dataset and TF-IDF Vectorization.
2. Utilize Spacy for advanced NLP tasks such as tokenization and named entity recognition.
3. Apply the Passive Aggressive Classifier for real-time detection of fake news articles.
4. Analyze the prediction results and assess the model's accuracy.

Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing labeled news articles for training and evaluating the prediction model.
